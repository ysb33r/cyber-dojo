    # It would also open up the architecture to
    # finer grained commits. Eg a next logical
    # step would be to tag-commit when switching files.

# a file-delta helps on two fronts
# 1. optimization; an unchanged file is not resaved.
# 2. testing; easy to specify which file changes I want to apply
