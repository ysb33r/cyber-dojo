test executes and creates a name.txt file which then appears
in the filelist.

1)
test executes again and creates name.txt file again
which contains different content.
The new content should be in the file in the file-list
SpyRunner will need access to FakeDisk/FakeDir

2)
coder edits the source file that created to the file name.txt
so it now creates the file  different.txt
and deletes the file name.txt from the filelist
Now then execute the tests.
-> name.txt should not be in the filelist
-> different.txt should now be in the filelist
SpyRunner will need access to FakeDisk/FakeDir
