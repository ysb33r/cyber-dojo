# -u www-data
#   Run as user=root and every container works.
#   But that's not good security.
#   So run as user=www-data
#   This causes only the containers built from mono to fail.
#   It is a rights issue...

#   Thus, currently, C#-NUnit, C#-SpecFlow, and F#-NUnit

#   automatically remove the container created by running inner_command
#   in the docker container (language.image_name). We are only interested
#   in the output produced. All files are saved and gitted off the
#   /katas sub-folder on the main server and not into the container.
#
# -v #{sandbox.path}:/sandbox:#{read_write}
#   volume mount the animal's sandbox to /sandbox inside the container
#   as a read-write folder. This provides isolation.
#
# -v #{language.path}:#{language.path}:#{read_only}
#   volume mount the language's folder to the same folder path+name
#   inside the container. Intermediate folders are created as necessary
#   (like mkdir -p). This provides access to supporting files which
#   were sym-linked from the animal's sandbox when the animal started.
#   Not all languages have symlinks but it's simpler to just do it anyway.
#   Mounted as a read-only volume since these support files are shared
#   by all animals in all katas that choose that language.
#
# -w /sandbox
#   working directory when the command is run is /sandbox
#   (as volume mounted in the first -v option)
#
# #{language.image_name}
#   the name of the docker container to run the inner-command inside.
#   specified in the language's manifest as its image_name.
#
# /bin/bash -c \"#{inner_command}\"
#   The command that is run inside the docker contaier is always
#   './cyber-dojo.sh' which is run via bash inside a timeout.
